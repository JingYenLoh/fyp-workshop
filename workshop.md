# Introduction<a id="sec-1"></a>

# JavaScript<a id="sec-2"></a>

## Equality<a id="sec-2-1"></a>

### Problem<a id="sec-2-1-1"></a>

What do you think is gonna happen below?

```js
return 1 == 1;
```

What about this?

```js
return 1 === 1;
```

ðŸ˜² So what's the difference ??!?!?

Well, let's try this&#x2026;

```js
return 1 == '1';
```

**Huh?**

```js
return 1 == [1];
```

**!!!**

```js
return 1 == true; // wat
```

    true

Ok, ok, we get the point. Why does this happen?

In JavaScript, `==` is the *abstract equality operator*. When comparing values with `==`, it converts both values to a common type. As an example, with [5](#org793ab51), it converts the `true` to a number before comparing.

```js
return Number(true)
```

So since 1 is equal to 1, `1 == true` evaluates to true.

### Solution<a id="sec-2-1-2"></a>

`===` is the strict equality operator. If the values are of different types, they're unequal.

```js
console.log(1 === '1');
console.log(1 === [1]);
console.log(1 === true);
return (undefined === null);
```

Well, most of the time anyway. You still get magical edge cases like this.

```js
return NaN === NaN;
```

TLDR; with JavaScript, **ALWAYS** use the strict equality operator (`===`) for comparison unless you really know what you're doing with `==`.

## Arrow Functions<a id="sec-2-2"></a>

Consider the following function:

```js
function multiply (x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
```

-   [ ] Something about anonymous

Arrow functions were influenced by CoffeeScript, a functional programming language that transpiled into JavaScript.

They make simple functions a lot more concise.

```js
const multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
```

The difference is particularly apparent when they're passed as arguments e.g. in Promise chains.

```js
fetch('www.example.com/api/v3')
    .then(function (response) {
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(function (json) {
        console.log(json);
    })

/* Versus */
fetch('www.example.com/api/v3')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => console.log(json))
```

But surely they weren't added just for a little syntactic sugar?

### ESLint<a id="sec-2-5-1"></a>

Before we get into ESLint, let's consider a common scenario that you might face while developing a project in a team:

```js
// You
console.log('Hello')

// Read 'names.txt' from file system and log result in console
fs.readFile('names.txt', function (file, err) {
    if (err) {
        throw err
    }
    console.log(file)
})
```

```js
// Your team member, noob-arse
console.log('Hello');

// wtf with this unused declaration
var fileCopy;

// Read 'names.txt' from file system and log result in console
fs.readFile('names.txt', function (file, err) {
if (err) {
    throw err;
}
console.log(file);
});
```

As you can see above, everybody have different conventions/approaches to writing and formatting their code. This introduces the issue of inconsistency as every member's code is formatted differently (and the code might be inefficient like noob-arse's unused `fileCopy` variable). 

With the abovemetioned example, wouldn't it be more productive if everyone adheres to a style guide, aka, a unified set of coding and formatting rules? Wouldn't we want to achieve a production ready, maintainable, quality code base?

Enter ESLint, a utility that checks if your JS syntax adheres to a particular style guide agreed on by your team. If your code does not meet the requirements of your style guide, you will get those pesky red underlines that you see when you write incorrect syntax in your favourite IDE, this is your cue to write quality code boi.

ESLint is plugin based too, so you can choose from the various style guides in the open source community (e.g. JS Standard, AirBnb style, etc), or create your own style guide to enforce in your project.

So to recap, ESLint is a utility that is used to ensure uniformity in your project's code base by making sure that the code written matches the rules of your project's style guide. This way, we can achieve a quality code base that can be well understood and maintained.
